# Multi-layer-Kernel-Machine

## About

This is a project to construct an efficient multi-layer kernel machine with Monte Carlo methods, using kernel approximation methods. Besides, we add some tricks such as residual learning and data splitting.

## Data

To complete our experiments, we use the YearPredictionMSD Data Set in which there are 463,715 train examples and 51,630 test examples. 
In each example, there are 90 attributes, and an outcome value: the year, ranging from 1922 to 2011.

The dataset is from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YearPredictionMSD
